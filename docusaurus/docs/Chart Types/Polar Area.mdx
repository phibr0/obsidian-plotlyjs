# Polar Area Chart

## Example

````yaml
```chart
type: polarArea
labels: [Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday]
series:
    - title: Title 1
    data: [1,2,3,4,5]
    - title: Title 2
    data: [5,4,3,2,1]
labelColors: true
width: 40%
```
````

The above code will render a _Polar Area Chart_.
A `width` Modifier is added to fix the width of the Chart. 
The Property `labelColors` is also set to `true`, which is the desired behaviour most of the time.
